# Financial Tracker

## Description of the Project

This java application tracks ingoing and outgoing finances. It functions as an electronic version of a checkbook ledger, and it's target audience is your everyday worker. This solves a few problems,
including misplacing a physical checkbook, budget mismanagement, and tracking the flow of money over different financial apps that do not integrate with each other, such as a couple with individual accounts
tracking their expenses as a house.

## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want to add and track deposits and payments to keep my account up to date.
- As a user, I want a menu with clear directions so that I can easily navigate where I need to go.
- As a user, I want the ability to filter my ledger to only show deposits or payments so that I can better track my money.
- As a user, I want the ability to navigate in and out of different parts of the menu without closing the application so that I can save time and effort.
- As a user, I want the ability to view a list of past transactions to moniotr my spending and income.
- As a user, I want the ability to generate reports on my spending and income at a specific vendor or timeframe so that I can make clear decisions about my budget.
- As a user, I want the ability to save my added transactions so that they are still there when I exit and restart the application.
