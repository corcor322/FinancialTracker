# Financial Tracker

## Description of the Project

This java application tracks ingoing and outgoing finances. It functions as an electronic version of a checkbook ledger, and it's target audience is your everyday worker. This solves a few problems,
including misplacing a physical checkbook, budget mismanagement, and tracking the flow of money over different financial apps that do not integrate with each other, such as a couple with individual accounts
tracking their expenses as a house.
